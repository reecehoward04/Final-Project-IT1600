# Drivers and Updates

From here, you would want to be installing any new BIOS updates, Windows drivers or software directly on your new computer. When it comes to installing new drivers and software, it's pretty much up to you what you want to do with your computer. I would recommend updating any Windows Updates, your graphics card drivers and your motherboard BIOS. The way people go about updating everything varies depending on what type of motherboard you bought and graphics card. 

# Windows Drivers/Updates

Step 1: In the search bar on the bottem of the Windows desktop, search up "Check for updates".

Step 2: This will take you to the Windows Update page and will probably start to download and install many files and updates that Windows will need.

Step 3: Let Windows finish their updates. (Your PC may restart a couple times)

# BIOS Update

Step 1: This varies from motherboard to motherboard on where you will be downloading your new BIOS updates, how you get access to your motherboards BIOS and how to propery install the new BIOS file.

Step 2: At this point, I would look up your EXACT make and model motherboard on the manufactures website, and they should have a list of instructions on how to install your new BIOS update properly. (IMPORTANT: When your PC starts the BIOS update, it is critical that your PC does NOT lose power while in the middle of the update. This could lead to your PC files becoming corrupted and some things unusable, even your OS.) 

# Graphics Drivers

Step 1: Head to your graphics card manufactuers website (usually NVIDIA or AMD), and you can look up on their website what current drivers are avalible for download.

Step 2: Depending on what graphics card you get, NVIDIA or AMD, both provide a software that includes auto-updating your graphics drivers and some overclocking features!

* [AMD RADEON SOFTWARE](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/software)

Step 3: After downloading your specific software, make sure you install the software on your computer.

Step 4: Once your installation of the software is complete, you should be given a little tour through the software on how to update your graphics drivers, overclocking, and any other features you may want to use.

Step 5: Download and update your graphics card drivers.

Step 6: Let your new graphics card drivers install, your PC may restart when this happens.

# And finally, after building, troubleshooting, installing new drivers & updates, you are now ready to use your newly built computer!
