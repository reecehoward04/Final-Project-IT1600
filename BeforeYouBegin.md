# Before You Begin:

# Step 1: Decide on your budget, what you will overall be doing (gaming, content creation, school, general use), and research what parts would handle your needs best.

This link will take you to Microsoft's website that will guide you on picking out which PC parts will suit your needs best! https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-me-choose

# Step 2: Purchase all necessary computer parts:

I recommend buying most of your parts from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/) or [MicroCenter](https://www.microcenter.com/)

But the website [PCPARTPICKER](https://pcpartpicker.com/) is a really good website that allows you to pick out all your parts and shows specific requirments you need so all your PC parts you buy are compatible! They also link you the cheapest website you can buy the parts from, which is usually one of the three sites I provided above.

CPU - (Central Processing Unit) - EX: Intel Core i5-14600KF (This is the brain of the computer that pretty much tells all the other components in your build what they need to do! The newest generation of Intel processors released this year, and the i5 is a great choice for whatever you might be doing!)

CPU Cooler - EX: NZXT Kraken 240mm AIO CPU Cooler (There are multiple ways you can cool your CPU, mainly air-cooling or liquid-cooling. Liquid cooling tends to be more effiencent at keeping your CPU cool compared to a stock fan CPU cooler you might get with your processor. Nowadays AIO (All-In-One) cpu coolers make it very easy to install and setup, compared to when you bought and installed flexible tubing and you had to 
fill the tubes up with cooling liquid yourself! I would personally take AIO liquid cooling over air cooling anyday!)
        
MOBO - (Motherboard) - EX: ASUS ROG Strix Z790-F (LGA 1700) (There are many different motherboard brands out on the market, the way you would go about buying your MOBO, would be to reserach what you will need on your motherboard so all your other parts are compatible with it! NOTE: When buying your CPU & MOBO, make sure your CPU and MOBO are compatible with each other! An AMD processor would not work with this example motherboard I provided since it has an LGA socket for Intel CPUs and not an AM4 socket for AMD.)
        
RAM - (Random-access memory) - EX: Corsair VENGEANCE DDR4 RAM (16gb of RAM I would say is the sweet spot right now for the amount of RAM you need, but for just general school work and browsing, 8gb of RAM will work just fine also.)

GPU - (Graphics Processing Unit) - EX: Nvida RTX 4060 8gb (This is a one of the newest graphics cards on the market today for a decent price, usually the most expensive part. But if your CPU does NOT come with integrated graphics, you will need a GPU, ESPICALLY while gaming or content creating.)

STORAGE - (M.2, SSD, HDD) - EX: Samsung 980 PRO 1tb (I personally would go with a 1tb M.2 drive over any SSD or HDD drive anyday, due to the fact it's small, the read and write speeds are extremely fast compared to the other types of drives, and it's easy to install on the motherboard)

PSU - (Power Supply Unit) - EX: EVGA 600W 80 Plus Power Supply (Now depending on what kind of parts you get or even how many parts you plan on installing, they all require POWER, obviously... For the parts I'm listing, 600 watts should be plently. But I always recommend getting at least 100 watts or more than what your PC needs. Just to be safe and in case you want to add any more components later on!)

PC Case - EX: NZXT H5 Flow (There are hundreds if not thousands of different PC cases, this is up to your liking and personal prefrences. But make sure that the components like the motherboard, system fans and even graphics card can fit in the case.)

Cooling solution - (Case fans) - EX: Corsair SP120mm Fan (Depending on your case, you want to have as much air flow as possible throughout your computer, and make sure we are getting all the hot air out! So make sure you are buying the correct size MM fans for your case and how many fans your computer can hold! Also, if you buy an All-in-One CPU cooler, the radiator that comes with it will need to be mounded to one of the fan locations on the computer, you could have a 120mm (1 fan) 240mm (2 fan) or even a 360mm (3 fan) radiator, so make sure you take that in to account on how many fans you really need!)

Input devices - (Keyboard, Mouse, ect...) (You will need a mouse and keyboard if you're building a desktop pc, 100%. But what you will use is up to you!)

Monitor - You will need some sort of display screen with an HDMI or Display port input to connect to your pc. Monitors come in many different flavors, but usually a 1920 x 1080 between 60 - 120hz is what the              average consumer uses. But if you plan on gaming, you're going to want a pretty fast response input delay and a high refresh rate to see what you're doing feel "buttery smooth".) 
Operating System - (Windows, Linux, Mac) - EX: Windows 10/11 (The Windows OS (Operating System) has been the most commonly used OS to date, people who like more control and who probably do more computer coding, prefer the Linux OS more and can be used just like Windows most of the time. Windows 11 is the newest OS Microsoft has released and you will need to buy a License/Product Key for your Windows OS so you can use all the features! NOTE: YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY WINDOWS TO USE IT! You can skip putting in a product code and completley use Windows for free! BUT, you cannot change your background, colors and any other items underneath the personalization settings. You can buy and activate your Windows whenever in the settings.)
