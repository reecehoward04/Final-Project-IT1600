# How to build a Desktop Computer (IT1600 - Final Project)
# By: Reece Howard

My final project will be about how to build a desktop computer from start to finish.
I'm going to be explaining all the parts and components you will need to build the PC, what you should be doing when building, and what you will need to do after the first time booting your computer.

# Target Audience

This tutorial is intended for people who want to maybe save a little money on a PC, who might want to learn the skill on how to build a PC to their own desires, or more than likely someone who just wants to play the newest AAA game at MAX settings and frames.
