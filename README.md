# How to build a Desktop Computer by Reece Howard (IT1600 - Final Project)
My final project will be about how to build a desktop computer from start to finish.
I'm going to be explaining all the parts and components you will need to build the PC, what you should and should not be doing when building, and what you will need to do after the first POST.
