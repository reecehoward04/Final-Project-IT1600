# Step-by-Step Assembly:

Step 1: (Prepare the Workspace) Clear a spacious, well lit area. Use an anti-static wrist strap or touch a grounded metal object to discharge static electricty. (It takes ALOT of static electircity to ruin a PC component but if you DON'T ground yourself, you could end up sending an electric shock through one of your components and fry it!)

Step 2: (Prepare the Motherboard) Once you made sure you are grounded, take out the motherboard and lay it on a flat surface and place the anti-static bag the MOBO came in underneath the board so that your motherboard is laying on top of the plastic. (This helps reduce static electricity.)

Step 3: (Install the CPU) Open the CPU socket on the motherboard. Align the CPU with the socket and gently place it in, ensuring the pins or contacts match. (There's usually a little arrow or pointer on the corner of the CPU and CPU socket on the MOBO that match up.) (You want to make sure you insert your RAM sticks in the correct slots, usually slots 02 & 04, for dual-channel memory support so your computer uses all the memory you installed.)

Step 4: (Install RAM) Refer to the motherboard manual for RAM slot placement (IT MATTERS). Open the RAM slots and align the notches on the RAM stick with the slot, then press down on both ends of the stick until 
it click into place.) (Make sure you insert the RAM sticks in the dual-channel slots on the MOBO, usually slots 02 & 04, because if you don't, your computer will not read your full amount of RAM you installed.)

# Depending on what parts you bought, the next steps may come easier or harder for you when you continue building, but in this tutorial, I'm going to be using the example parts I listed and how I find building a PC this way tends to be a little easier and you have more room to work with.

Step 5: (Install Storage) If we bought a motherboard with an M.2 drive slot on it (which most new ones have) then that's 2 less cables we have to manage and run from the powersupply to the motherboard since the M.2 drive installs directly onto the motherboard. (Refer to your motherboard maunel for M.2 slots and where you should install them.)

Step 6: (Install the MOBO in Case) After prepping the motherboard with the CPU, RAM and storage, we are ready to mount the motherboard in the case. There is usually stand-off screws that come with the PC case or motherboard that will line up with the outter screw holes on the motherboard. (Refer to the PC Case manual to see where your stand-off screws get installed.) 

Step 7: (Install CPU Cooler) Depending on the CPU cooler you buy, it make be a simple install or it could become really difficult. The AIO cooler I talked about is pretty easy to install. 
        
Step 7.1: First, you want to mount all of the fans provided in the CPU cooler box to the radiator the correct way (refer to the CPU Cooler manuel for which way they get mounted). 

Step 7.2: Once you mounted the fans to the radiator, you want to locate a spot in your case where you want to mount the radiator/fans. 

Step 7.3: Then once the radiator is mounted in the case, the other end of the AIO cooler which carries your liquid coolant to from your radiator to the cooling block, needs to be mounted on top of your CPU/socket. 

Step 7.4: Usually with an AIO like this, a back-plate that's provided gets mounted/installed on the back of the motherboard on the other side of the case. You can usually see 4 corner holes around the CPU socket on the back of the motherboard where the bracket goes. (NOTE: THERE CAN DIFFERENT WAYS AIO brackets get installed, PLEASE refer to the manual to see the manufactuers steps.)

Step 7.5: Once the back CPU cooler bracket is installed, you can take the cooling block (what cools the cpu) and remove the platic shielding protecing the thermal paste.

Step 7.6: Very carefully, place the cooling block on the CPU socket, screw in the 4 corner screws of the cooling block to press and hold down the cpu cooler on top of the CPU in place!

Step 7.7: There should be lots of cords with an AIO cpu cooler, I would be trying to get most of those lines hidden in the back of the case where they can't be seen, but I do know the AIO fan pump power is a short cord usually connected to the cooling block you installed just before, that gets plugged in from the block to the top right of one of your motherboard pins. (Refer to your motherboard maunal to locate the correct pin location and refer to AIO Cooler manual on how you connect everything on the back side.)
        
Step 8: (Installing the PSU) (NOTE: IT IS USUALLY EASIER TO PLUG EVERYTHING IN FROM THE PSU TO MOBO FIRST, THEN MOUNT THE PSU INTO THE CASE.) The power supply unit is pretty simple to install, it usually gets installed on the bottem/back side of the computer where your MOBO and GPU plug-ins (ports) are located also. Make sure you are installing the PSU the correct facing way for the fan to keep the component cool while running (This usually depends on where you're installing the power supply, but with the PC case I provided as an example, there's a PSU fan filter on the bottem of the case which indicates the fan must be installed facing down to keep airflow to the PSU.)

Step 9: (Pluging in everything) By this point, you probably have a good amount of cables your staring at wondering where to start next. Usually when it comes to the PSU cables and plugging in everything, they are responsible for providing power throughout the entire PC. You want to try to keep the cables as straight and as tight as possible to the back side of the case so you don't end up with a rats nest at the end. Usually the PC case box provides zip ties so you can cable manage on the back of the PC, but trust me, it's hard to cable manage sometimes and it depends on the amount of space you have in the case overall. This is how I would plug everything in one at a time. (I WOULD HAVE THE MOTHERBOARD MANUAL PROVIDED READY SO YOU CAN SEE ALL THE CORRECT LOCATIONS WHERE EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE PLUGGED IN)
        
Step 9.1: I would start by plugging in the motherboard cord (MB) from the powersupply to give my overall motherboard/system power. (Usually located on the right side facing the MOBO)

Step 9.2: Then plug the (CPU1) cord from the PSU into the motherboard to provide the CPU power. (Usually located on the top left/middle of the MOBO)

Step 9.3: Plug in all the front panel connecions that were pre-installed into the case (Power button, reset, front panel, HD audio, USB ports, ect...) into the correct pins on the bottom of the motherboard. (Usually located on the bottem of the motherboard.) (Sometimes the motherboard manufacuter will provide a front panel connection adapter so you can use all the front panel ports your PC case provides.)

Step 9.4: The SATA1 & SATA2 ports on the powersupply will provide power to the AIO cpu cooler radiator and fans connected to it. There's usually a little fan controller that gets mounted via double-sided sticky tape on the back inside of the PC case (behind the motherboard), which is where you plug in all your fan cords too. (Refer to your AIO manual to see the exact locations for where everything gets plugged into)

Step 9.5: By this point, you probably have a rats nest of cords, try using zip ties or any velcro tape to organzie your cables as best as your can. (Don't be suprised if itsn't perfect at first, it takes time to cable manage)

Step 10: All that is left is to install our graphics card onto the motherboard (usually below the CPU socket and RAM slots). There is usually a couple of PCIe slots on the motherboard. Depending on the GPU you picked out, it may be too big/large to fit on the top PCIe slot on the motherboard, so you may have to move the GPU to a PCIe slot below where it can fit in the case/on the MOBO properly. Which will determine which PCIe plate bracket you will remove on the back of your case. 
        
Step 10.1: On the back of the PC Case, there should be some skinny metal brackets located around underneath your motherboard ports that you can unscrew from the outside. Removing this bracket will allow the display outputs on the GPU that you are going to install to be shown and used on the back of the PC.

Step 10.2: After determining what PCIe slot you will use on the MOBO and what PCIe plate brackets you removed on the back of the pc for your diplay outputs, you can take your GPU and install it into the PCIe slot.

Step 10.3: The GPU is now seated onto the PCIe slot on the Motherboard, take the (VGA1) cable from the powersupply and plug it into the GPU, this will provide your GPU power.

Step 11: By this point, your PC should power on if you did everything correctly and decided to just stop after the most previous step. Now it's time to plug in a monitor, mouse and keyboard.
        
Step 11.1: Attempt to power on your PC by hitting the power button on the front. (MAKE SURE YOU PLUG IN YOUR FRONT PANEL CABLES OR YOUR POWER BUTTON WILL NOT WORK! AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR CABLES CONNECTED/SEATED PROPERLY ON YOUR MOTHERBOARD!)

Step 11.2: If you start to see life/power in your computer, you will usually see on the motherboard itself a sequence of colors (USUALLY Green, Yellow, and Red) indicating the POST process of bringing all your computer parts to life. If everything goes well, you're motherboard should flash a little light to boot into the BIOS settings of your Motherboard. On the BIOS screen, you can usually see most of the componenets you got installed  when the PC is running.

Step 11.3: Power down your computer and unplug everything, including the cord from your power outlet to your power supply. 

Step 12: If you followed my instructions and didn't mount your PSU in the case until the end, that would be my next step for you to do. But if it's already mounted in the case, then you can continue reading.

Step 12.1: Finish up any cable management and start to install your PC case panels back on to cover up your cable management mess. 

# By this point, you will have built yourself your very own PC! It seems like a lot at first, but once you do 2-3 builds, it gets pretty simple after that. BUT, we're almost done, not 100%. We still need to install our operating system (Windows 10/11).

Step 13: On a computer or laptop that you already have and works, go to Microsoft's website by searching up on any web browser, [Create installation media for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d)

Step 13.1: You will need a USB flash drive with at least 8gb of storage or more plugged into your computer to create your Windows installation media device. 

Step 13.2: Follow the steps on Microsoft's website to download the windows installation media, it will ask a couple of questions on where you would like to create a windows installation drive, and you will choose the USB thumb drive you plugged into your computer.

Step 13.3: After the program installs the Windows installation media on the USB thumbdrive, you can remove the USB from your computer and go plug it into your new desktop you just built.

Step 14: After plugging in your windows installation media usb to your new computer, you can plug everything back in if you haven't already and power it on and with the USB stick inserted.

Step 14.1: You should start to see the startup process from Windows and it's pretty simple from here, just follow the on-screen steps.

Step 14.2: Continue your first Windows startup by signing in, setting passwords, and personal prefrences.

Step 14.3: After a few potential restarts by Windows, you should be on the home desktop of your new PC.

# You have now successfully completed installing Windows, and now you can use your new PC!
